          <h2> The Legacy of Thunder & Lightning</h3>
          <p>
            The Teamsters emblem prominently features two horses, <strong class="highlight">Thunder & Lightning</strong>, 
            paying homage to the union’s origins in the era of horse-drawn transport. These horses symbolize 
            the values that have guided the Teamsters for over a century: strength, unity, and resilience.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Thunder</strong> represents unwavering power and determination, reflecting the solidarity of 
            the union’s members. <strong>Lightning</strong> embodies agility and adaptability, signifying the ability 
            to evolve while staying true to the principles of fairness and justice. Together, they reinforce the 
            core values that have made the Teamsters a pillar of strength in labor representation.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we look to the future, the inclusion of <strong class="highlight">Thunder & Lightning</strong> in our new logo 
            design ensures that this legacy remains at the heart of our identity, inspiring current and future generations 
            of Teamsters.
